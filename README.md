# CS_330_Final_Project
3D Scene using OpenGL

1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  This project required a lot of rework in the design process. The multiple redesigns pointed out the advantage of finding repeatable processes that can be used multiple times throughout the project.
  
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I began with a very simple top down design, writing basic pseudocode for the project. Then I broke that into smaller parts, and expanded on them.
  
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This project made it glaringly obvious that it is good practice to research the tools/libraries/APIs I will be using on a project before spending too much time on design. Much of the time spent redesigning could have been avoided with a better understanding of openGL.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Based on the Milestone rubric requirements, I began working with the most complex item in my scene. I will not use this approach with a technology I am unfamiliar with again in the near future.

o	How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was hugely important to the development of this project. Each Milestone required improvement to the shape we had already implemented.

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My original goal of creating 3-4 complex shapes had to be abandoned due to the steep learning curve of this course. It was important to be able to find ways to implement the shapes in a simpler fashion.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I have learned that computational graphics and visualizations are extremely complex, and require large attention to detail to correctly implement.

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
This course on computational graphics and visualizations has pointed out that I will need to spend more time reading documentation and seeking out an understanding of fundamentals with new technology. Computational graphics and visualizations, or at least openGL, does not lend itself to intuitive learning.
